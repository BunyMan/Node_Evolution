# Node_Evolution

This simple python script has the single purpose of helping the process of plotting a certain node from fem.dat and FEM.NEU files, to run it 
simply write python3 evolution.py with it in the same directory as your node files, it will then ask you the number of the node you want to plot 
and how many files you want it to read. Once it's done runnig, you'll have a new .txt file with all the info from the node you selected.
